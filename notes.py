# Variables in python are the ones we use to store different kinds of data types.

'''name = "micky" #this variable contains a string data type value.
age = "23" #this variable contains a number data type called (int) value.
height = '170.5' #this variable contains a number data type called (float).
members = {"micky", "joel", "nati"} #this variable contains a list data type.'''

#when declaring a variable we can't use spacing and also we can't start with a number, and can't also use (print) as a variable.
#meanwhile we can use an underscore for spacing on a variable.

'''is_members = True #a boolean data type variable written with a plain case.
isMembers = False #a boolean data type variable written with a cammel case. '''

#control structures are blockes of codes that analyze variables and choose cjoose directions in which to go.
#we use control structures for decision making, and to repeat tasks for processing.

#CONDITIONAL_STATEMENTS--->(IF, IF...ELSE, ELIF)

#IF --> anything under this statement will only work if the condition is true.
#IF...ELSE--> if the condition is true excute the first, if not the 2nd.
#ELIF--> this statement allows for more than one condition.
    #examplesðŸ‘‡
'''if False:
    print("this condition is not true")
    print(2>5)'''
    
'''if m>h:
    print("its true")
else:
    print("not right")'''



#LOOP-->(WHILE, FOR, RANGE)

#WHILE-->  repeates the codeblock as long as the condition is true.
#FOR--> we usually use for loop for lists.
        #example
'''students = ["micky", "nati", "sami"]
for x in students:
    print(x)'''
#RANGE--> generates a sequence of numbers, and used with FOR loop.
'''for i in range(1, 20, 0.5):
    print(i)'''
